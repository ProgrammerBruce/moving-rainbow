Welcome to the Moving Rainbow
==============

Learn Computer Science the fun way!

Moving Rainbow is a Arduino-based hardware kit and set of labs to teach students the basic concepts of Computer Science using some fun electronics components.  We focus on the use of Arduinos, breadboards and addressable LED strips to create fun projects.

- [Getting Started](guide/getting-started.md) - How to download and use Arduino IDE
- [Hardware](guide/hardware.md) - Description of the hardware components of the Moving Rainbow kits
- [Programming Guide](guide/programming.md) - How to program the Arduino to control the LED strip
- [Instructor's Guide](guide/instructors.md) - A guide for instructors on how to use the kits to teach the concepts of Computer Science
- [Bill of Materials](guide/bill-of-materials.md) - Parts you can order on-line to build your own kits
- [Glossary of Terms](guide/GLOSSARY.md) - Some terms we use in this guide

Being able to control the world around us creates a wonderful feeling of empowerment.  We are no longer limited to what our cellphone or laptop can do.  We can program lights and motors around to obey our every command.  The Moving Rainbow kits will be your guide.  You will start out with a simple blink lab but quickly move to exotic colors, patterns and motion.  We can even hook up sensors to change the LEDs based on what is happening in the world around us.

## Book Versions
In addition to reading the manual directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/dmccreary/moving-rainbow) there are two versions of this book that are rendered in on-line book forms:
1. [Read the Docs Book](http://moving-rainbow.readthedocs.org/en/latest)
2. [GitBook](http://dmccreary.gitbooks.io/moving-rainbow)

Moving Rainbow Addressable LED Kits
----------

Although this guide is designed to work with a simple kit of parts you can purchase on-line for about $13, it can be used by anyone that has an Arduino and a addressable LED strip.  You can find sample links to the parts ![here].

Once you have become familiar with the Arduino and the LED kit you can then try your hand at using the CoderDojo Robot Kits.

Good Luck!
